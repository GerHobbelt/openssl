# Notes on the draft-03 to draft-04 transition

The [diff](https://tools.ietf.org/rfcdiff?url2=draft-ietf-tls-esni-04.txt)

## Comments/whines:-)

- ESNIKeys -> ESNIRecord change, hmm, why add 2nd extensibility field?
    - AddressSet moves to outer extensions struct - meh
    - zero would be better
- Mandatory extensions via code points - yuk!
    - turns out I missed that was in -03 already (and maybe before;-)
    - it's still dim!

## Coded up (not really tested)

DONE - ESNIKeys changes:
    - delete checksum and not before/after - yay!
 
DONE - record_digest in encrypted_server_name extension based on other octets
    - seems to be up to but not including the dns_extensions

DONE - ServerNameList -> dns_name in PaddedServerNameList
    - added version as input to esni_pad and handle thusly

DONE - Greasing - add client code  
    TODO - not sure how to handle server extension value if all client did was grease
    - invented new grease esnikeys version (0xffff), set that
      as default in new SSL contexts and behave accordingly

## Not yet done...

- add esni_retry_request server response, is part of...

- HRR processing - I've never checked it out, so in related news...

- key and iv label changes - I don't do anything yet for HRR so take both
    into account when I address that - added a TODO to the code (noting
    that we're likely to end up using [hpke](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-barnes-cfrg-hpke)
    anyway so going too soon here may waste effort unless someone wants 
    to test our HRR handling)

- decide whether or not to support "mandatory" extensions - I'm not
  minded to for now

- add trial decryption and BS record_digest which is fine
    - how does one "omit" the record_digest, as claimed?

- split-mode - still haven't really gone there yet at all
